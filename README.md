# Members-Only (Messageboard App)

A basic messageboard app that allows all visitors to view messages. Visitors can sign-up and then create messages. If given a special code, you can become a 'member' which will allow you to view author and dates for each message on the board. A special 'admin' code will allow you to become an admin and delete messages from the board.
